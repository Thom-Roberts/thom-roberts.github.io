## My various projects

### [React box game](https://thom-roberts.github.io/box-game/)
  - My first project working with React. I took their Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial and changed it to this game I played a lot as a kid.
  
### [Destiny 2 clan site](https://thom-roberts.github.io/ts-clan/)

  - I wanted to try my hand at making a more full fledged React site. I was somewhat familiar with Bungie's Destiny API, so I wanted to make a site about some of the various clan statistics I could find. 
  - I built some AWS lambda functions that powered some of the clan statistics lookup information, so I didn't need to make those requests each time the page loaded. The labmda functions went into a Dynamo DB database, which the site would make requests to and parse into usable data.
  - The 'ts' meant I used TypeScript for this site. I've grown to much prefer TypeScript to plain JavaScript.
  
### [Square Color Game](https://thom-roberts.github.io/ColorGame/)

  - This game was made as part of an Introduction to Unity class. This was me working on my own for a week to get it developed, with some required components (such as 2D & 3D models).
